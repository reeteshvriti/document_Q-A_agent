# document_Q-A_agent
I built a RAG-based multi-PDF Q&amp;A system using LangChain, where users can upload multiple documents and chat with them in a context-aware way. The system uses OpenAI embeddings, ChromaDB for vector storage, GPT-3.5 Turbo for responses, and stores chat history in SQLite for session continuity.
