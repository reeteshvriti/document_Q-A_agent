No Policy of Life Insurance shall be called in question on any ground whatsoever after expiry of 3 yrs\nfrom\na. the date of issuance of policy or\nb. the date of commencement of risk or\nc. the date of revival of policy or\nd. the date of rider to the policy\nwhichever is later.\n2.

Fraud means any of the following acts committed by insured or by his agent, with the intent to deceive the\ninsurer or to induce the insurer to issue a life insurance policy:\na. The suggestion, as a fact of that which is not true and which the insured does not believe to be true;\nb. The active concealment of a fact by the insured having knowledge or belief of the fact;\nc. Any other act fitted to deceive; and\nd. Any such act or omission as the law specifically declares to be fraudulent.\n4. Mere silence is not fraud unless, depending on circumstances of the case, it is the duty of the insured or his\nagent keeping silence to speak or silence is in itself equivalent to speak.\n5. No Insurer shall repudiate a life insurance Policy on the ground of Fraud, if the Insured / beneficiary can\nprove that the misstatement was true to the best of his knowledge and there was no deliberate intention to\nsuppress the fact or that such mis-statement of or suppression of material fact are within the knowledge of\nthe insurer. Onus of disproving is upon the policyholder, if alive, or beneficiaries.\n6. Life insurance Policy can be called in question within 3 years on the ground that any statement of or\nsuppression of a fact material to expectancy of life of the insured was incorrectly made in the proposal or\nother document basis which policy was issued or revived or rider issued. For this, the insurer should\ncommunicate in writing to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of insured, as\napplicable, mentioning the ground and materials on which decision to repudiate the policy of life insurance\nis based.\n7. In case repudiation is on ground of mis-statement and not on fraud, the premium collected on policy till\nthe date of repudiation shall be paid to the insured or legal representative or nominee or assignees of\ninsured, within a period of 90 days from the date of repudiation.\n8. Fact shall not be considered material unless it has a direct bearing on the risk undertaken by the insurer.\nThe onus is on insurer to show that if the insurer had been aware of the said fact, no life insurance policy\nwould have been issued to the insured.\n9. The insurer can call for proof of age at any time if he is entitled to do so and no policy shall be deemed to\nbe called in question merely because the terms of the policy are adjusted on subsequent proof of age of life\ninsured. So, this Section will not be applicable for questioning age or adjustment based on proof of age\nsubmitted subsequently.\nDisclaimer: This is only the relevant extract of the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015.

Progressive Scleroderma -\nA systemic collagen-vascular disease causing progressive diffuse fibrosis in the skin, blood vessels and\nvisceral organs. This diagnosis must be unequivocally supported by biopsy and serological evidence and the\ndisorder must have reached systemic proportions to involve the heart, lungs or kidneys.\nThe systemic involvement should be evidenced by any one of the following findings -\nLung fibrosis with a diffusing capacity (DCO) of less than 70% of predicted\n Pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 25 mmHg at rest measured\nby right heart catheterisation\n Chronic kidney disease with a GFR of less than 60 ml/min (MDRD-formula)\n Echocardiographic findings suggestive of Grade III and above left ventricular diastolic dysfunction\nThe diagnosis must be confirmed by a Consultant Rheumatologist or Nephrologist.\nThe following are excluded:\n Localised scleroderma (linear scleroderma or morphea);\n Eosinophilic fascitis; and\n CREST syndrome.\n22.

Poliomyelitis - The occurrence of Poliomyelitis where the following conditions are met:\n Poliovirus is identified as the cause and is proved by Stool Analysis,\n Paralysis of the limb muscles or respiratory muscles must be present and persist for at least 3 months.\n24. Loss of Limbs - The physical separation of two or more limbs, at or above the wrist or ankle level limbs as a\nresult of injury or disease. This will include medically necessary amputation necessitated by injury or disease.\nThe separation has to be permanent without any chance of surgical correction. Loss of Limbs resulting\ndirectly or indirectly from self-inflicted injury, alcohol or drug abuse is excluded.\n25. Deafness - Total and irreversible loss of hearing in both ears as a result of illness or accident. This diagnosis\nmust be supported by pure tone audiogram test and certified by an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) specialist.\nTotal means “the loss of hearing to the extent that the loss is greater than 90decibels across all frequencies of\nhearing” in both ears.\n26. Loss of Speech - Total and irrecoverable loss of the ability to speak as a result of injury or disease to the\nVocal Cords. The inability to speak must be established for a continuous period of 12 months. This diagnosis\nmust be supported by medical evidence furnished by an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist.\n27.
